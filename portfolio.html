    <h1><h1>Projects</h1></h1> 
       <p>Below is a list of some of the projets we have undertaken as we continued on our research.
        <p>Socia Economic Activities. We have analysed the various activities that the communities are involved in to increase their 
            economic satus and improve on their living standards and chose the below to assist them.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
                <h1>Bore holes</h1>
                <p>We have dung several boreholes to aid in easy access of clean water so that the women and children can 
                    easily get water for their domestic use and easily water their crops and animals.
                </p>

            <li>
                <h1>Animal husbandry</h1>
                <p>We provide capital for the communities to start small projects eg chicken rearing, goat farming
                    for milk and meat supply. They can aslo be sold to increase family cash flow.
                </p> 
            </li>
            <li>
                <h1>Educational Materials</h1>
                <p>We provide learning materials for the communities to learn new ideas eg business.
                    We also provide them with spiritual learning materials like bibles and bible study materials.
